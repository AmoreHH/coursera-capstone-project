## Build a Regression Model in Keras
This is the course project of the [Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras?specialization=ai-engineer) at [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer).



## Project Description
- Build a regression model using the deep learning Keras library.
- Experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers
- Observe how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.


### Methods Used
- Data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Data processing/cleaning


### Technologies
- python with jupyter lab 
- pandas and numpy 
- sklearn
- tensorflow
- keras

### Data Information
The dataset is about the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them. The variables include: 

1. Cement
2. Blast Furnace Slag
3. Fly Ash
4. Water
5. Superplasticizer
6. Coarse Aggregate
7. Fine Aggregate
8. Age
9. Strength [target]

### Four Models
1. Baseline model
2. Normalized version of the data
3. Increate the number of epochs
4. Increase the number of hidden layers

### Evaluate 
- MSE(mean squared error)
