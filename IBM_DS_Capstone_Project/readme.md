## Winning Space Race with Data Science
This is the capstone project of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).\
We need to follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders. \
My final presentation slide is here: [IBM DS Capstone Report](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/IBM_DSCapstone_Amore.pdf)

### Project Purpose
- Predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully

### Project background and context
- SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million
dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
- We can determine the cost of a launch through determine if the first stage will land

### Problems want to find answers
- What are the factors which influence the rocket landing successfully
- The best classification models

### Data Information

- Data Collection : 
    - [from SpaceX API](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/SpaceX_Lab1_Data_Collection_API.ipynb)
    - [Web scraping Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launches Records from Wikipedia
](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/SpaceX_Lab1_Data_Collection_with_WebScraping.ipynb)


### Methods Used
- EDA
    - [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/SpaceX_Lab2_Data_Wrangling.ipynb)
    - [Exploratory Analysis Using SQL](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/EDA_with_SQL-github.ipynb)
    - [Data Visualization](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/SpaceX_EDA_with_Data_Visualization.ipynb)
- Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
    - [Launch records interactively with Plotly Dash](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/spacex_dash_app.py)
    - [launch site proximity with Folium](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb)
- [Predictive Analysis (Classification)](https://github.com/AmoreHH/coursera-projects/blob/main/IBM_DS_Capstone_Project/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb)
